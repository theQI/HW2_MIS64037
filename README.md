This is the solution to the HW2 question based on the college scorecard data in https://ed-public-download.apps.cloud.gov/downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-Scorecard-Elements.csv
Original question from blackboard:
The objective is to predict median graduate debt. You will use the College Scorecard data. I am more interested in how you approach this dataset, as it contains many missing values. Please perform all aspects of model and variable selection, and regression assumption checking. Also, write a short report detailing your finding.
